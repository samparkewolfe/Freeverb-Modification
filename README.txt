Freeverb Mod:

This program is based off of the Freeverb reverb unit made by Jezar in 2000.
This is a algorithmic reverb unit which I have added the functionality of being able to tune each comb filter and all pass filter individually.
I really wanted to get my head around algorithmic reverb and how it worked so doing this project was perfect for learning the ins and outs of reverb.
A lot of the code is still the original Freeverb source code but I have labeled which parts I have modified and included the original source code for cross referencing.
